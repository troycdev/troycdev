# Hi, I'm Troy ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer and student, currently in my first year studying Computer Science at the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/).

I have experience using several languages including JavaScript, Python and Java, and technologies such as Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB and Git. I do freelance work as a full-stack web developer, and work on a variety of development projects in my free time.
